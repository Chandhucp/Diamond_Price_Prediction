## Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Diamond_Price_Prediction
```

## Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset:


The dataset used for this project contains information about diamonds, including carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth, along with their corresponding prices. The dataset is stored in the file `gemstone.csv`, which should be placed in the `notebooks/data` directory.

## Installation:

Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Chandhucp/Diamond_Price_Prediction.git
   ```
  
### Usage:

  To run the project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:



#### 1.Prepare the dataset:

Place the diamonds.csv file in the data directory.



#### 2.Data preprocessing: 

Open the Jupyter Notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb and execute the cells to perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. This notebook also includes exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.



#### 3.Model training and evaluation: 

Open the Jupyter Notebook model_training.ipynb and execute the cells to build, train, and evaluate various machine learning models using scikit-learn. The notebook implements a pipeline to streamline the preprocessing and modeling steps, allowing for efficient and reproducible model development.





## Project Structure
### The project directory consists of the following files and directories:

- Data: Directory to store the dataset.
- EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
- Model_training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for model building, training, and evaluation using pipelines.
- Model_trainer.py: Jupyter Notebook for feature importance analysis and result visualization.
- README.md: Documentation file describing the project.
- requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries for easy installation.


# Results:
The project achieves accurate diamond price prediction by machine learning algorithms,  linear regression. The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The feature importance analysis provides insights into the factors influencing diamond prices.
